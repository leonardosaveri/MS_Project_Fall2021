# MS_Project_Fall2021
Project for the class "30549 Mathematical Statistics (Fall 2021)," held by Professor Botond Tibor Szabo at Bocconi University.

The aim of the following project is to find whether there is a correlation between a song danceability and acousticness and its popularity. In a second moment I also took a first look to one of the many steps of cross validation to predict a song popularity based on its danceability, acousticness, key, mode and music genre.
